Subject: Seeking Guidance on Your Impressive OSRE 2022 Contributions

Hi Nimra,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Daud, and I recently came across the incredible list of contributions you made during OSRE 2022. Your work on Demos and Tutorials caught my attention, and I'm truly impressed by your expertise in OpenRoad.

As someone aspiring to make meaningful contributions in a similar domain, I believe learning from experienced individuals like yourself is invaluable. Your success in OSRE 2022 is inspiring, and I'm keen to understand more about your journey and the insights you gained during your contributions.

I understand your time is valuable, but if you could spare a few moments for a quick chat or share some pointers via messages, I would greatly appreciate it. Your guidance would mean a lot as I embark on my own endeavors in this field.

Looking forward to the possibility of connecting and learning from your experiences.

Best regards, Daud Farzand

P.S. I would be thankful and forever consider your kindness a great favor, and in turn, help another person when I am learned. Thoroughly require your guidance, as a contributor from Pakistan.

1.  Specifically, I want to know your whole experience, suggestions, and every bit of info I can get _haha_ regarding DEMOS & TUTORIALS.
2.  A more detailed account of your technical stack - OpenRoad - why - and any other prerequisites I should know beforehand.

Afternote: Nimra, I am excited to have come across a fellow Techie from Pakistan. It is cool to see and ask you for guidance. Impressed and high-key proud to see you on the 2022 contributors list.
